<h1>About Food4Good</h1>
<hr style="width:100%;text-align:center;margin-left:0">
<p>Food4Good is a non-profitable platform that connects charities and resturants together. It allows 
    resturants to sign up and donate any left over food (that they may have made in bulk) to charaties 
    or NGO's around them at the end of the day. This way, there would be less food wastage, and people in need would be helped. The platform is generally for resturants, but feel free to sign up and donate even if you are not a part of one. Do a good deed for society.</p>
